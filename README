NAME
	orphan-reaper - Keep your process tree clean.

SYNOPSIS
	orphan-reaper [--fatal] [--] COMMAND...

DESCRIPTION
	This user daemon spawns a process and reaps all orphaned
	grandchildren. This is useful if you want to keep your
	process tree clean. For instance if you want all programs
	started from inside the same display server instance to
	appear to be inside that display if you look inside the
	process tree, rather than all processes that loses their
	parent being reparented to PID 1 and make a mess on your
	process tree.

OPTIONS
	--fatal
		Fail if the process cannot become a subreaper.

RATIONALE
	It is really nice to have a processes that are running
	inside a display server to be a grandchild of the
	display server, rather than being reparanted to PID 1.
	Especially when multiple display servers are running.
